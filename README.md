# 🧠 Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) - A Complete Guide

A **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** is the foundational architecture of deep learning. It maps fixed-size input data to an output through layers of artificial neurons, enabling powerful modeling of nonlinear relationships in data.

## 📐 What is a Feedforward Neural Network?

A **Feedforward Neural Network** is a type of artificial neural network where data flows in **one direction only**:

- No cycles or loops.
- No internal state or memory.
- Fundamental to modern deep learning architectures.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 1. **Input Layer**
- Accepts raw input features.

### 2. **Hidden Layers**
- One or more layers.
- Each neuron computes:
  \[
  z = w^T x + b,\quad a = f(z)
  \]
  Where:
  - \( w \) = weights
  - \( x \) = inputs
  - \( b \) = bias
  - \( f \) = activation function (e.g., ReLU)

### 3. **Output Layer**
- Returns prediction.
- Activation depends on task:
  - **Sigmoid** for binary classification
  - **Softmax** for multi-class classification
  - **Linear** for regression

## ⚙️ How It Works

### ▶️ Forward Propagation
- Passes data through each layer.
- Applies activation functions.

### 📉 Loss Computation
- Compares predicted output to actual using a loss function (e.g., MSE, cross-entropy).

### 🔁 Backpropagation
- Uses gradients and the chain rule to update weights.
- Optimization usually with gradient descent or Adam.

## 🧰 Common Activation Functions

| Function | Description | Usage |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| ReLU     | \( f(x) = \max(0, x) \) | Hidden layers |
| Sigmoid  | \( \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \) | Binary classification (output) |
| Tanh     | \( \tanh(x) \) | Zero-centered output |
| Softmax  | Multinomial distribution | Multi-class output layer |

## 📦 Use Cases

| Domain         | Application Example                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Classification | Spam detection, sentiment analysis           |
| Regression     | Price prediction, sales forecasting          |
| Finance        | Credit scoring, risk modeling                |
| Healthcare     | Disease prediction from symptoms             |
| Industry       | Predictive maintenance, quality control      |

## ✅ Strengths

- **Universal function approximator**
- **Simple and flexible**
- **Fast inference**
- **Easy to implement and train**

## 💡 When to Use FNNs

| Situation                         | Use FNN? | Why                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| Tabular data                     | ✅ Yes   | Ideal for structured inputs          |
| Text, image, or sequence data    | ⚠️ Maybe | CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers preferred |
| Regression or classification     | ✅ Yes   | Flexible and effective               |
| Time-series prediction           | ❌ No    | Use RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers     |
